# Race Timing System

This is an entry for the [CSEE Soc](https://www.essexstudent.com/organisation/6490/) Summer Challenge. The original challenge is in [./doc/requirements.md](./doc/requirements.md) I _may_ have gone a little overboard with it, using Azure AD B2C as an IDP and a multi layered design... I'm going to document the entire setup though...

The frontend will be fount at [https://rts.buttes.dev](https://rts.buttes.dev) while the backend will be at [https://api.rts.buttes.dev](https://api.rts.buttes.dev), with the OpenAPI/Swagger frontend at [https://api.rts.buttes.dev/swagger](https://api.rts.buttes.dev/swagger)
